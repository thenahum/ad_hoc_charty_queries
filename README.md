# ad_hoc_charty_queries

This folder contains ad-hoc charty queries I use in pythonista to gather data for charts. These are not super cleaned up, so feel free to tweet at me with any questions @thenahumgarcia. 

Below are the iCloud shortcuts link to build out the charts:
1. [Tasks by Project](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/faf030e1f5524bdab57f63e227e3d065)
2. [Task Dashboard](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/0ab67eb6adc74f2d923d64d3864dcc58)

You just need to download the folder into your Pythonista iCloud folder, and you should be able to run the shortcut without issue. If there is an issue make sure the Pythonista URL in the shortcut matches where you stored the scripts.
